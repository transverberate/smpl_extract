<h2>1. Akai disk format overview</h2>
Akai floppy disks are formatted as 2 sides of 80 tracks with 5 or 10 sectors per 
track. Each sector is 1024 bytes long, giving a total of 800k (low density) or 
1600k (high density). PCs use 9 or 18 sectors of 512 bytes and will not read Akai 
floppies without reprogramming. As far as I can tell, Mac floppy drives can't 
read Akai floppy disks at all. 
<p>Unwritten bytes on a disk are set to zero. Multi-byte values have the lsb first 
  (little-endian). This document refers to the first byte in a block as 'byte 
  1', not 'byte 0'. All values are decimal unless otherwise stated. 
<p>Akai hard disks and CD-ROMs use the same file format as Akai floppy disks, 
  and virtually the same disk format. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>2. S900/S950 disk format</h2>
Track 1, side 1 starts with 64 entries of 24 bytes as follows:
<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Format      Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------
     10     ASCII       Filename
      6                 0
      1     ASCII       File type: 'S'=sample, 'P'=program, etc.
      3     unsigned    File length in bytes
      2     unsigned    Starting block on disk
      2                 S900 ID = {0,0}</font></pre>
Bytes 1536 to 3136 (1536 to 4736 for high density) contain a map of how
the blocks on the disk are used, in the form of 2-byte unsigned integers.
For example, if a file starts at block 5, map entry 5 may contain the value
6, indicating that the next block to read is block 6. The next block to
read is then given by map entry 6. The map entry for the last block of
a file contains the value 32768. Unused blocks have a map entry of zero. The first 4 blocks are needed for the file entries and map.
<p>Note that the S950 can use high-density disks and can read S1000 disks, but 
  the S900 can only read S900 or S950 low-density disks. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2><a NAME="3"></a>3. S900/S950 sample format</h2>
A S900 sample file has a header of 60 bytes as follows:
<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Format      Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------
     10     ASCII       Filename
      6                 0
      4     unsigned    Number of sample words
      2     unsigned    Sample rate (Hz)
      2     unsigned    Tuning (16ths of a semitone, C3=960)
      2                 0 
      1     ASCII       Loop mode (O=one-shot, L=loop, A=alt)
      1                 0
      4     unsigned    End marker
      4     unsigned    Start marker
      4     unsigned    Loop length
     20                 140,185,0,78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,224,43,38,0,0,0</font></pre>
(I don't know what is held in the last 20 bytes, but the values shown seem
to work).
<p>You can use lower case letters in filenames (not available from the front panel) 
  but avoid unusual ASCII characters. Do not put two files with the same name 
  on a disk! 
<p>The header is followed by the (12-bit signed) sample data, packed in a very 
  strange way: For a sample of N words, the upper 4 bits of the first byte contains 
  the lower 4 bits of the first word. The lower 4 bits of the first byte contain 
  the lower 4 bits of word N/2. The second byte contains the upper 8 bits of the 
  first word. This repeats for the first N bytes, after which there are N/2 bytes 
  containing the upper 8 bits of the last N/2 words.
<p>&nbsp;
<h2><a NAME="4"></a>4. S1000 disk format (and S1100 and S01)</h2>
With the S1000, Akai abandon ASCII (mostly) and use their own alphanumeric
code, which I shall refer to as AKAII:
<pre><font color="#000099">    Character    ASCII       AKAII
   ----------------------------------
     0 - 9       48 - 57     0 - 9              
     space       32          10
     A - Z       65 - 90     11 - 36
     #           35          37
     +           43          38
     -           45          39
     .           46          40</font></pre>
The file entries and map are in the same position as the S900, but have
changed slightly:<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Format      Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
     12     AKAII       Filename
      4                 32,32,32,32
      1     ASCII       File type: 's'=sample, 'p'=program, etc.
      3     unsigned    File length in bytes
      2     unsigned    Starting block on disk
      2                 S1000 ID = 0,3</font></pre>
Empty entries also have the S1000 ID byte. Note that file types are lower-case
ASCII.  The map now uses a value of 19152 as an end marker, and the
first five blocks (file entries and map) are marked with values of 16384.
<p>There is a volume label at the end of the map (byte 3136 or 4736 depending
on density) consisting of a 12 byte AKAII name followed by 0,0,0,ID,0,1,1,0,0,0,50,9,12,255
where ID = 3 for the S1000.
<p>Note that the S01 uses the S1000 format for disks and samples, but with an 
  ID of 1,0 for high density and 0,1 for low-density unused entries. The S1100 
  probably uses the same format with a different ID.
<p>&nbsp;
<h2><a NAME="5"></a>5. S1000 sample format</h2>
The S1000 sample file has a 150 byte header: 
<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Format      Description

<h2>
<a NAME="5b"></a>6. S1000 program format</h2>
The S1000 program file consists of a 150-byte header followed by one or more 150-byte keygroup entries.<BR>Most parameters are stored as signed or unsigned single bytes.

<h2><a NAME="6"></a>7. S3000 disk format</h2>
The S3000 disk has space for file entries and map the same as for the S1000,
but has a value of 255 at byte 17 signifying that these file entries will
be ignored, and 512 entries starting at block 5 will be used instead. The
first 17 map entries are marked with the value 16384.

<h2><a NAME="9"></a>10. Teledisk format</h2>
<p>Akai distribute some of their sound library in the Teledisk .TD0 format. Following 
  a variable length header (including several null-terminated comment lines) data 
  blocks from the floppy disk are stored sequentially. In the uncompressed format 
  each 1024 byte block is preceded by 9 bytes of address information with an additional 
  4 bytes at each track boundary. Any further information on this mysterious format 
  would be welcomed! </p>

<h2><a NAME="10"></a>11. MESA file format</h2>
The PC Beta release of MESA uses a 'mesa' chunk following the waveform data, containing 
a copy of the S3000 series sample header: 
<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Format              Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

      1     0                   Padding to make chunk length even</font></pre>
MESA II for PC does not use a &lt;mesa&gt; chunk, but uses the standard &lt;smpl&gt; 
chunk for tuning and looping information with sample start and end points stored 
in a &lt;cue &gt; chunk. 
<p>For more information on the WAV file format see <a href="http://www.wotsit.org">http://www.wotsit.org</a>
<p>&nbsp;
<h2><a NAME="11"></a>12. S5000/S6000 sample format</h2>
The S5000 and S6000 can read files produced by earlier samplers, but by
default use WAV files on MS-DOS formatted disks. The WAV files saved by operating system version 1.01 use standard chunks but are
somewhat unconventional:
<pre><font color="#000099">   RIFF 'WAVE'
     &lt;fmt > - Describes mono or stereo 16-bit PCM (plus 2 unused bytes at end)
     &lt;fact> - Describes number of sample words (not actually required for PCM)
     &lt;smpl> - Tuning and loop information plus 18 bytes of manufacturer specific data
     &lt;data> - Waveform data (16-bit signed, interleaved if stereo)</font></pre>
<p>A single loop is supported, with the loop mode held in the manufacturer specific 
  data. The &lt;smpl&gt; chunk is written before the &lt;data&gt; chunk and any 
  other chunks are stripped off by the sampler. To ensure smooth operation filenames 
  should be less than 20 characters with the WAV extension capitalised. The manufacturer 
  specific data (manufacturer 71, product 94) contains the following parameters 
  but can be omitted if not needed: 
<pre><font color="#000099">   Length   Description           Default

      1     Original root note    60
      1     Semitone tune +/-36   0
      1     Fine tune     +/-50   0
      1                           0     
      1     Play mode             0=NO LOOPING 1=ONE SHOT 2=LOOP IN REL 3=LOOP TIL REL
      3                           0,0,0
      4     Start point           0
      4     End point             (number of sample words)</font></pre>
<p>A loop tuning parameter is also stored in the above structure but is not yet 
  implemented in the sampler operating systems.

<h2><a NAME="12"></a>13. S5000/S6000 program format</h2>
<p>Program files have an .AKP extension and are described <a href="AKPspec.html">here</a>.<br>
  Multi files (multitimbral setups of programs) have an .AKM extension.<br>
  Both formats are loosely based on the RIFF file format. </p>

<h2><a NAME="13"></a>14. PC floppy drive programming</h2>
<p>Code for the adisk4 program is provided <a href="adisk4-c.txt">here</a> showing 
  how to re-program the floppy drive for Akai disk access and includes read, write 
  and format functions. Note that the code is primitive both in style and content! 
  The software will work under DOS and Windows 3.x/95/98, but not NT which blocks 
  direct disk access.</p>
<p>Not all PCs can read all Akai disks. Some modern PCs are obviously not as &quot;IBM 
  Compatible&quot; as they should be, but problems can also be caused by the long 
  hard life many Akai floppy drives have had. Some problems can be solved by using 
  a disk formatted in Akai format by the PC rather than the sampler.</p>

<h2><a NAME="14"></a>15. This document</h2>
This information contained in this file was worked out by experimenting with the 
floppy drive parameter table until Akai disks could be read, and then examining 
the data of numerous disks and files, comparing the contents to the sampler's 
parameter settings and SysEx data. I'm happy to receive corrections or additions 
to include in this document.
